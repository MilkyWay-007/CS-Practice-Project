-= Java Dialogue System Project =-

Initialized and maintained by:
- Hanfang Z.

Purpose:
- This is a practice Java Git project where I (the author of README.md) started learning repository, combining object-oriented principles with application with database (SQLite) as a plan

Current Stage:
- Github and Git are set properly for any future updates
- Learning SQLite and database
- Establishing the Java system and how the database may be introduced into the application

Future Next Step:
- Dec 15: A Java project with multiple classes that runs 
- Dec 20: Introducing database into project
- Expected finishing time: Dec 30

Some Words from Me (Hanfang Z.):
- Glad to meet you, whoever is reading this
